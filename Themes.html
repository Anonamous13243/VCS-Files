        The turtles, april and casey meet professor honeycutt AKA the fugitoid and travel into space to find the pieces to stop the triceratons from using the heart of darkness.
        They travel into space and made new enemies Lord dregg and armaggon. Raphael also found his girlfriend Mona lisa, who is an extraterrestrial salamander. They were also able 
        to meet there counterparts from 1987 and stopped kraang 1987 from wiping out their dimesion. 6 months had past and the triceratons have all the pieces to the heart of darkness. 
        The turtles and their allies defeated the triceratons and stopped the heart of darkness, and splinter had hurt the shredder pretty badly and won the war. Then april was announced 
        as a kunoichi to the turtles and karai's best friend shinigami moved to new york from Japan. Meanwhile the shredder was doing an experiment to help him regain his strength. The 
        shredder was now mutated to super shredder and killed splinter. The turtles come up with a plan to defeat the shredder once and for all. During the battle, Leonardo decapitated

        After the shredder's defeat, Tigerclaw was trying to resurrect the him with the help of kavaxas. They need shredder head and heart to resurrect him. The turtles try to stop him from 
        bringing the shredder back form the dead, but they were too late and kavaxas was free from the stone that controls him. Michelangelo was able to fix the stone and save the city from 
        kavaxas's rage. Afterwards, the Turtles face different challenges like the return of Lord Dregg when he collaborates with Newtralizer, being transported to Miyamoto Usagi's reality 
        where they help to protect the pug Kintaro from the evil gray wolf Jei, an adventure featuring an alternate future ruled by mutant animals, and another adventure involving the return 
        of Savanti Romero where he collaborates with Count Dracula to make Earth more habitable for monsters. Then Bebop and rocksteady were allied with 1987 shredder and kraang to destroy the 
        world. The turtles have help from their counterparts to help defeat the shredder and Kraang 1987. They stopped their plan with the help of bebop and rocksteady and send them back to 
        their dimesion. After that, a major catastrophe as Raphael traverses a wasteland Earth, along with Donatello (whose consciousness is transferred into a robot). They eventually encounter 
        Michaelangelo (who has become a hippie guru, "The Holy Chalupa") and finally Leonardo, who had lost his memory and sanity and mutated into the archvillain Maximus Kong, before Raphael is 
        finally able to re-trigger Leonardo's consciousness, reuniting the four core characters for a bittersweet happy ending.
