        The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a Nickelodeon show that premiered on September 28, 2012.
        It features four mutant turtles - Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo - who are fighting against
        a powerful assassin, known as the Shredder. The turtles hide in the shadows battling Shredder's army
        and strategizing on how to defeat him. However, a greater threat looms over Earth in the form of the Kraang,
        tiny alien brains intent on transforming Earth into Dimension X.Set in New York City, the turtles reside in 
        the sewers with their rat father, Splinter.Together, they are determined to protect their planet from any 
        danger that comes their way.

        <p>
            First up is the blue leader, Leonardo. Leonardo is the leader of the TMNT and is an honorable ninja.
            He was chosen as the leader by Splinter and takes great pride in it. He is smart, kind, honorable, and skilled in
            ninjutsu. He can sometimes become frustrated with his team because they often do not listen to his instructions and  
            prefer to do their own thing. Despite this, Leonardo is proficient with a sword, has strategic planning abilities, and 
            is also friends with the mighty mutants, April O'Neil, Casey Jones, and Karai. Leonardo was the one who ultimately 
            defeated the Shredder and ended the war. He also played a crucial role in defeating the Kraang after they turned 
            Earth into Dimension X. While Leonardo can be strict with his team, he remains a good and noble fighter.

        <p>
            Up next is the hotheaded turtle, Raphael.Raphael is the red ninja who has a bad temper. He 
            often gets annoyed pretty easily, but besides that, Raphael is a strong, stubborn, skilled, hotheaded, and 
            rebellious ninja. He is the muscle of the TMNT team. He does get a bit jealous of Leo becoming the leader and 
            thinks he cando a better job than him. Raphael does have a soft spot for the ones he cares about. Raphael 
            then becomes best friends with Casey Jones, after they had a brief battle with each other. Raphael seems to 
            be the one responsible for Casey when he gets himself into trouble. Raphael knows how to use his weapons, 
            ninjutsu, enhanced strength, and stealth. He is also in a relationship with Mona Lisa, an extraterrestrial salamander 
            that Raphael met. Raphael may not care too much about people, but he is still willing to help his brothers defeat
            the Shredder.

        <p>
            Now the brains of the group is Donatello. Donatello is intelligent, kind, noble, and sometimes anxious. He is 
            usually the one who has to come up with every solution because of how smart he is. He gets annoyed at that sometimes
            because it can be too much pressure for him and he doesn't want to be the one responsible for it. He is the smartest of the 
            group, which makes him the most reliable in inventions and gadgets to help in any situation. Donatello knows how to fight 
            with the bo staff, ninjutsu, intelligence, stealth, and agility. He also has a crush on a beautiful girl, April O'Neil.He has been 
            trying to get to her even though April doesn't seem that interested in him. They may be good friends, but I think that would just be it
            for them.

        <p>
            Next is Michelangelo. He is the youngest turtle of the brothers and is known for being very goofy, silly, rebellious, creative
            , and kind. He is definitely the most playful ninja of the group. Michelangelo can be resourceful at times when he really needs to be,
            in order to save the people he cares about. He can be naive when meeting new people or interacting with those he already knows. Additionally,
            he can be smart with his photographic memory. For example, when he accidentally bumped into Donnie's shelf and reorganized it
            without even thinking about it. Michelangelo pays attention to whatever interests him in a cool way, but can be reckless with  
            his choices. He is skilled in fighting with nunchuks, ninjutsu, intuition, creativity, and unpredictability. He has a talent 
            for befriending others even when they may not see the good in them. Michelangelo gives everyone a chance and is not afraid
            to try new things, even though he knows they may not work. While he can be childish at times, he has a big heart and cares deeply 
            for the people and mutants he knows.

        <p>
            Now it is the old rat, Splinter also known as Hamato Yoshi. Splinter is an old mutated rat that live in the sewers with his sons: Leonardo,
            Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. Splinter is an overprotective, paranoid, wise, strict father, who cares deeply about his kids.
            While Splinter can be a bit stern about the decisions the turtles make sometimes, it's really for their own good. Splinter doesn't usually
            go out on adventures with his sons because it's their destiny, not his. He can be a good teacher at times, but he mainly spends most of his time with
            Leo because he is the leader and wants to teach him everything he knows about leadership. Splinter knows Ninjutsu, wisdom, weaponry, healing,
            high intuition, and pressure point intuition. Splinter also has a daughter, Karai. Her original name was Miwa, but he was kidnapped by Oroku Saki, also known as
            the Shredder. Shredder held Splinter's daughter captive for over 15 years, but Karai found out the truth and came to live with her true father. Splinter's 
            rivalry with the Shredder has gone from brothers to archenemies. Throughout the years they have been competing with each other for a while. This all started
            with a girl, Tang Shen. She was Splinter's girlfriend, but was killed by the Shredder by mistake. Splinter may have had a hard past, but he is still
            focused on the things he cares about in the present.

        <p>
            Next up is Donnie's love interest, April O'Neil. April is a high school teenager who was captured by the Kraang. She possesses psychic powers
        because her DNA is part Kraang and part human. April is smart, mysterious, and stubborn. She meets Casey Jones after he almost hits her with a hockey 
        puck. The two become friends and later develop a romantic relationship. They get along sometimes, but Casey's recklessness and April's stubbornness sometimes create challenges 
        in their relationship. April was trained by Splinter to become a kunoichi, a female warrior. She also becomes friends with the turtles after they save her from the Kraang
        and they start hanging out together. Donnie often showers April with gifts and attention because of his strong feelings for her, but April does not feel the same
        way. She tries to maintain a friendship with Donnie even though he wants more. April is skilled in ninjutsu, psychic powers, weaponry, intelligence, and speed.
        She is a valuable ally and will continue to help the turtles until Shredder is defeated.

        <p>
            Next up is the vigilante Casey Jones. Casey is reckless, stubborn, and arrogant. He has become friends with the turtles, especially Raph who is his best
            friend. After they had a fight, they were able to compromise and work together. He has two hockey sticks, a bat, and hockey pucks which he uses
            as tools to help take down his opponents. Casey can be pretty foolish at times, taking on mutants who are much stronger or bigger than he is. He 
            even went after the Shredder, thinking he could take him down, but he often acts before thinking things through. Casey possesses skills in hockey, strength,
            speed, and driving. He may be impulsive and foolish, but he means well and will do anything to help his friends.

            Now, the main antagonist of the series is the Shredder. Shredder is a dangerous fighter who seeks revenge on Hamato Yoshi/Splinter. He tirelessly 
            attempts to kill Splinter for what he has done to his life. Shredder is highly delusional, aggressive, petty, pretentious, and manipulative, 
            bordering on a psychopathic and emotionless spectrum. He has a right-handed sidekick, Tigerclaw, whom he found after his trip to Japan. Shredder is 
            working on hiring people to help him defeat Splinter and the Turtles. He also captured Splinter's daughter Karai, and raised her as his own. Shredder
            possesses knowledge of martial arts, immense strength, intelligence, stealth, and acrobatics. He also collaborates with the Kraang to help him achieve 
            his goals by making deals with them. Shredder did accomplish his goal of killing Splinter and achieved a sense of happiness. However, after Splinter's 
            death, he was killed by Leonardo by decapitating his head.

             <p>
                In Season 2, the Turtles celebrate their victory, but a bigger problem arises when mutagen falls from the sky and crashes onto the ground.
                This mutagen turns everyone into mutants, including April's dad who mutates into a vampire bat. Blaming the Turtles for her father's mutation,
                April leaves and meets Casey Jones with whom she forms a relationship. Donnie becomes jealous of Casey for "stealing" his girl, leading to a  
                confrontation between Raph and Casey. Eventually Raph and Casey become best friends after teaming up against Footbot. Meanwhile, Shredder 
                returns from Japan with his new second-in-command, Tigerclaw. Karai infiltrates the Turtles hideout and discovers the truth about her mother, 
                as well as the fact that Splinter is her true father. Fueled by hatred for Shredder, Karai seeks revenge and ends up getting captured. She is exposed
                to the mutagen and transforms into a horned viper. As the Kraang perfect the mutagen and launch their invasion, Shredder targets 
                Splinter and Leonardo. Leonardo successfully battles Shredder's army but sustains serious injuries in the process. The Turtles, April, 
                and Casey flee the battle and seek refuge at a farm house up north.

                The turtles retreated to April's farm house and Leo woke up from his coma after three months, attempting to recover. They had many adventures  
                at the farm house, including defeating the Creep, meeting Bigfoot, stopping the Speed Demon, and befriending an army of toads. Leo noticed that they were 
                becoming lazy and not training as much, so he suggested a three-day camping trip just for the turtles. During their camping trip Splinter's spirit 
                appeared in the fire and instructed them to go on separate journeys to face their greatest challenges. They succeeded in their missions and returned to New York. 
                Upon their return, the turtles found Spinter and established a new hideout at a pizza place. Donnie created a batch of retro mutagen with Mikey's help and saved the citizens of 
                New York. Meanwhile, Shredder sent out his new henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady, to find Karai and change her back. The turtles then encountered a time-traveler 
                named Renet who sent them back in time to where Splinter and Shredder were. They met Tang Shen who shared everything she knew about the feud between 
                Splinter and Shredder. As if things weren't complicated enough, a new alien species, the Triceratons began invading Earth to destroy the Kraang. This ultimately led to 
                the Triceratons destroying Earth. The Turtles, April and Casey managed to escape on a Fugitoid ship before the planet's destruction.

                The Turtles, April and Casey meet Professor Honeycutt also known as the Fugitoid and travel into space to find the pieces needed to stop the Triceratons from using the Heart of Darkness.
                They encounter new enemies, Lord Dregg and Armaggon. Raphael reunites with his girlfriend Mona Lisa, an extraterrestrial salamander. They also meet their counterparts from 1987 and prevent 
                Kraang 1987 from destroying their dimension. Six months pass and the Triceratons gather all the pieces for the Heart of Darkness. The Turtles and their allies defeat the Triceratons, 
                stopping the Heart of Darkness. Splinter severely injures the Shredder, leading to victory in the war. April is announced as a kunoichi to the Turtles and Karai's best friend Shinigami moves 
                from Japan to New York. Meanwhile the Shredder undergoes an experiment to regain his strength, resulting in his mutation into Super Shredder, who kills Splinter. The Turtles devise a plan to 
                defeat the Shredder once and for all. During the battle, Leonardo decapitates the Shredder, ending his reign. The Turtles destroy Shredder's army and live peacefully in New York.

                After the Shredder's defeat, Tigerclaw attempted to resurrect him with the help of Kavaxas. They needed Shredder's head and heart to bring him back to life. The Turtles tried to stop them from 
                resurrecting the Shredder, but they were too late and Kavaxas was freed from the stone that controlled him. Michelangelo managed to repair the stone and save the city from 
                Kavaxas's wrath. Following this, the Turtles faced various challenges, including the return of Lord Dregg who teamed up with Newtralizer, being transported to Miyamoto Usagi's reality 
                where they protected the pug Kintaro from the evil gray wolf Jei, an adventure in an alternate future ruled by mutant animals, and another involving the return of Savanti Romero collaborating 
                with Count Dracula to make Earth more habitable for monsters. Bebop and Rocksteady joined forces with the 1987 Shredder and Kraang to destroy the world, but the Turtles received help from their 
                counterparts to defeat them and send them back to their dimension. Afterwards, a major catastrophe occured as Raphael journeyed through a wasteland Earth along with Donatello whose consciousness 
                was transferred into a robot. They eventually met Michelangelo, now a hippie guru known as "The Holy Chalupa" and Leonardo, who had lost his memory and sanity, mutated into the archvillain Maximus Kong, 
                Raphael was able to trigger Leonardo's consciousness, reuniting the four core characters for a bittersweet happy ending.

                In may 2011, Nickelodeon published subject-to-change concept art of all four turtles, along with artwork from the studio's revamped Winx Club series.
                Both shows were developed simultaneously at Nickelodeon Animation Studio as part of the company's strategy to reboot two established brands for 
                new viewers. TMNT was geared to a core target demographic of boys aged 6 to 11, while Winx Club was intended to reach a similar age group of girls.
                 For their version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Nickelodeon also took note of a secondary audience in teens and adults. In June, it was revealed 
                 that the show's creative team would be led by designer Ciro Nieli and writers J. R. Ventimilia and Joshua Sternin. The three crew members held an 
                 interview the following month; they mentioned that the turtles would be differentiated physically, but that their personalities would not be changed.
                  Nieli stated that he had been influenced by the 1984 comics, while Ventimilia and Sternin were fans of the 1987 series and 1990s films in college.

                In March 2012, final artwork from the series was leaked on the Nickelodeon website before it was taken down. The images showed the designs of all four turtles,
                 Shredder, Splinter, a teenage April O'Neil and the Kraang, an alien race that combines elements of both Krang and the Utroms. A trailer for the series was 
                 released on June 21, 2012, on Nickelodeon USA. In July, Playmates released the show's merchandise ahead of its television debut.
