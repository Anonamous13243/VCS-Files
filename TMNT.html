            First is the blue leader, Leonardo. Leonardo is the leader of the tmnt and is an honorable ninja.
            He was chosen leader by splinter and takes pride in it. He is a smart, kind, honorable, and skilled
            ninja. He can be a bit frustrated with his team because most of the time they don't listen to what Leonardo 
            says to them. They usually do the their own thing or something else. While leonardo knows how to swing the sword,
            he also knows ninjutsu, and has strategic planning. He also is friends with the mighty mutants, april o'neil, casey jones,
            and karai. Leonardo also was the one who killed the shredder and ended this war. He also help defeated the kraang 
            after they turned earth into dimesion x. Leonardo can be a bit strict of his team, but is still a good, and noble 
            fighter.
