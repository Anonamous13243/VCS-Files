            First is the blue leader, Leonardo. Leonardo is the leader of the TMNT and is an honorable ninja.
            He was chosen leader by Splinter and takes pride in it. He is a smart, kind, honorable, and skilled
            ninja. He can be a bit frustrated with his team because most of the time they don't listen to what Leonardo 
            says to them. They usually do their own thing or something else. While Leonardo knows how to swing the sword,
            he also knows ninjutsu and has strategic planning. He also is friends with the mighty mutants, April O'Neil, Casey Jones,
            and Karai. Leonardo also was the one who killed the shredder and ended this war. He also helps defeat the Kraang 
            after they turn Earth into dimension x. Leonardo can be a bit strict with his team, but is still a good, and noble 
            fighter.

            Up next is the hotheaded turtle, Raphael. Raphael is the red ninja who has a bad temper. He 
            often gets annoyed pretty easily, but besides that, Raphael is a strong, stubborn, skilled, hotheaded, and 
            rebellious ninja. He is the muscle of the TMNT team. He does get a bit jealous of Leo becoming the leader and 
            thinks he can do a better job than him. Raphael does have a soft spot for the ones he cares about. Raphael 
            then becomes best friends with Casey jones, after they have a brief battle with each other. Raphael seems to 
            be the one who is responsible for Casey when he gets himself into trouble. Raphael knows how to use his weapons, 
            ninjutsu, enhanced strength, and stealth. He also is in a relationship with mona Lisa, an extraterrestrial salamander 
            that Raphael met. Raphael may not care too much about people but is still willing to help his brothers defeat
            the shredder.

            Now is the brains of the group, Donatello. Donatello is intelligent, kind, noble, and anxious at times. He is 
            usually the one who has to come up with every solution, because of how smart he is. He gets annoyed at that sometimes
            because it can be too much pressure for him and doesn't want to be the one responsible for it. He is the smartest of the 
            group, which makes him the most reliable on inventions and gadgets to help in any situation. Donatello knows how to fight 
            with the bo staff, ninjutsu, intelligence, stealth, and agility. He also has a crush on a beautiful girl
