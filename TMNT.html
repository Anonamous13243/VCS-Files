        <p>
            First is the blue leader, Leonardo. Leonardo is the leader of the tmnt and is an honorable ninja.
            He was chosen leader by splinter and takes pride in it. He is a smart, kind, honorable, and skilled
            ninja. He can be a bit frustrated with his team because most of the time they don't listen to what Leonardo 
            says to them. They usually do the their own thing or something else. While leonardo knows how to swing the sword,
            he also knows ninjutsu, and has strategic planning. He also is friends with the mighty mutants, april o'neil, casey jones,
            and karai. Leonardo also was the one who killed the shredder and ended this war. He also help defeated the kraang 
            after they turned earth into dimesion x. Leonardo can be a bit strict of his team, but is still a good, and noble 
            fighter.

        <p>
            Up next is the hotheaded turtle, Raphael.Raphael is the red ninja that has an bad temper. He 
            often gets annoyed pretty easily, but besides that, Raphael is a strong, stubborn, skilled, hotheaded, and 
            rebellious ninja. He is the muscle of the TMNT team. He does get a bit jealous of leo becoming leader and 
            thinks he cando a better job than him. Raphael does have a soft spot for the ones he cares about. Raphael 
            then becomes best friends with casey jones, after they had a brief battle with each other. Raphael seems to 
            be the one who is responsible for casey when he gets himself into trouble. Raphael knows how to use his weapons, 
            ninjutsu, enhanced strength, and stealth. He also is in a relationship with mona lisa, an extraterrestrial salamander 
            that raphael met. Raphael may not care too much about people, but is still willing to help his brothers defeat
            the shredder.

        <p>
            Now is the brains of the group, Donatello. Donatello is an intelligent, kind, noble, and anxious at times. He is 
            usually the one who has to come up with every solution, because of how smart he is. He get annoyed at that sometimes
            because it can be too much pressure for him and doesn't want to be the one responsible for it. He is the smartest of the 
            group, whihc makes him the most reliable on inventions and gadgets to help in any situation. Donatello knows how to fight 
            with the bo staff, ninjutsu, intelligence, stealth, and agility. He also has a crush on a beautiful girl, april o'neil.He has been 
            trying to get to her even though april didn't seem that interested in him. They may be good friends, but I think that would just be it
            for them.

        <p>
            Next is michelangelo. Michelangelo is the youngest turtle of the brothers. He is very goofy, silly, rebellious, creative
            , and kind. He is definitely the more playful ninja than the others. He can be resourceful at times when he really needs to be
            in order to save the people he cares about. He can be naive sometimes when he meets new people or people he already knows. He can 
            also be smart at times with his photographic memory, when he accidently bumps into the shelf with donnie's stuff and reorganized it
            without thinking about it. He can pay attention to whatever interests him in way that is cool, but can be very reckless with what he 
            plays with. Michelangelo knows how to fight with nunchuks, ninjutsu, intuition, creativity, and unpredictability. Michelangelo can 
            befriend others even though others can't see the good in them, but michelangelo can see the good in others and gives them a chance.
            He wouldn't hesitate to try new things, even though he knows that they won't work. Michelangelo can be childish sometimes, but he has 
            a big heart and loves the people or mutants he knows.

        <p>
            Now it is the old rat, Splinter AKA Hamato Yoshi. Splinter is an old mutated rat that live in the sewers with his sons: Leonardo,
            Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. Splinter is an overprotective, paranoid, wise, strict father, who cares deeply about his kids.
            While splinter can be a bit stern about the decisions the turtles make sometimes, it's really for there own good. Splinter doesn't usually
            go out on adventures with his sons, because it's there destiny, not his. He can be a good teacher at times, but he mainly spents most of his time with
            Leo because he is the leader and wants to teach him everything he knows about leadership. Splinter knows Ninjutsu, wisdom, weaponry, healing,
            high intuition, and pressure point intuition. Splinter also has a daughter, Karai. He original name was miwa, but he was kidnapped by oroku saki AKA 
            the shredder. Shredder held splinter's daughter captive for over 15 years, but karai found out the truth and came to live her true father. Splinter's 
            rivalry with the shredder has gone from brothers to archenemies. Throughout the years they have competing with each other for a while. This all started
            with a girl, Tang shen. She was splinter's girlfriend, but was killed by the shredder by mistake. Splinter may have had a hard past, but is still
            focused with the things he cares about in the present.

        <p>
            Next is donnie's love interest, april o'neil. April is a high school teenager that wasa captured by the kraang. She possesses some psychic powers
        cause of her DNA was part kraang and part human. April is smart, strange, and stubborn. She meets casey jones after casey almost hit her with a hockey 
        putt, the two become friends and later a thing. They get along sometimes, because of casey recklessness, and april's stubborness that get in the was with 
        their relationship. April was trained by splinter to become a kunoichi, a woman warrior. She does become friends with the turtles after she was saved by the 
        kraang and started to hang out with them. Donnie kinda bugs april with gifts and attention because of how much he likes her, but april doesn't have the same feeling
        for him. She would just try to stay friends with donnie even though he doesn't want to. April knows ninjutsu, her psychic powers, weaponry, intelligence, and speed.
        April is definitely a good ally and she will continue to help serve the turtles until shredder is defeated.

        <p>
            Next is the vigilante, Casey jones. Casey is a reckless, stubborn, and arrogant. Casey became friends with the turtles especially raph who is his best
            friend. After they had a fight with each other, they were able to compromise and work together. He has 2 hockey sticks, a bat, and hockey putts. He uses them
            as tools to help take down his opponents. Casey can be pretty dumb sometimes, when he takes on other mutants that are ten times stronger or bigger than he is. He 
            also went after the shredder, thinking that he copuld take him down, but he usually just acts before thinking things through. Casey knows how to play hockey, strength,
            speed, and driving skills. Casey is an impulsive and idiotic teenager, but he means well and will do anything he can to help his friends.

                After the shredder's defeat, Tigerclaw was trying to resurrect the him with the help of kavaxas. They need shredder head and heart to resurrect him. The turtles try to stop him from 
                bringing the shredder back form the dead, but they were too late and kavaxas was free from the stone that controls him. Michelangelo was able to fix the stone and save the city from 
                kavaxas's rage. Afterwards, the Turtles face different challenges like the return of Lord Dregg when he collaborates with Newtralizer, being transported to Miyamoto Usagi's reality 
                where they help to protect the pug Kintaro from the evil gray wolf Jei, an adventure featuring an alternate future ruled by mutant animals, and another adventure involving the return 
                of Savanti Romero where he collaborates with Count Dracula to make Earth more habitable for monsters. Then Bebop and rocksteady were allied with 1987 shredder and kraang to destroy the 
                world. The turtles have help from their counterparts to help defeat the shredder and Kraang 1987. They stopped their plan with the help of bebop and rocksteady and send them back to 
                their dimesion. After that, a major catastrophe as Raphael traverses a wasteland Earth, along with Donatello (whose consciousness is transferred into a robot). They eventually encounter 
                Michaelangelo (who has become a hippie guru, "The Holy Chalupa") and finally Leonardo, who had lost his memory and sanity and mutated into the archvillain Maximus Kong, before Raphael is 
                finally able to re-trigger Leonardo's consciousness, reuniting the four core characters for a bittersweet happy ending.

                In may 2011, Nickelodeon published subject-to-change concept art of all four turtles, along with artwork from the studio's revamped Winx Club series.
                Both shows were developed simultaneously at Nickelodeon Animation Studio as part of the company's strategy to reboot two established brands for 
                new viewers. TMNT was geared to a core target demographic of boys aged 6 to 11, while Winx Club was intended to reach a similar age group of girls.
                 For their version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Nickelodeon also took note of a secondary audience in teens and adults. In June, it was revealed 
                 that the show's creative team would be led by designer Ciro Nieli and writers J. R. Ventimilia and Joshua Sternin. The three crew members held an 
                 interview the following month; they mentioned that the turtles would be differentiated physically, but that their personalities would not be changed.
                  Nieli stated that he had been influenced by the 1984 comics, while Ventimilia and Sternin were fans of the 1987 series and 1990s films in college.

                In March 2012, final artwork from the series was leaked on the Nickelodeon website before it was taken down. The images showed the designs of all four turtles,
                 Shredder, Splinter, a teenage April O'Neil and the Kraang, an alien race that combines elements of both Krang and the Utroms. A trailer for the series was 
                 released on June 21, 2012, on Nickelodeon USA. In July, Playmates released the show's merchandise ahead of its television debut.
